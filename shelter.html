      <p>The Bengal tiger, also called the royal Bengal tiger (Panthera tigris tigris), is the most numerous tiger subspecies. It is the national animal of both India and Bangladesh.[2] By 2011, the total population was estimated at fewer than 2,500 individuals with a decreasing trend. None of the Tiger Conservation Landscapes within the Bengal tiger's range is considered large enough to support an effective population size of 250 adult individuals. Since 2010, it has been classified as endangered by the IUCN.[1]
        As of 2010, Bengal tiger populations in India have been estimated at 1,706–1,909.[3] As of 2014, they had reputedly increased to an estimated 2,226 individuals,[4] but the method used in the census may not be accurate.[5][6]
        Bengal tigers number around 440 in Bangladesh and 163–253 in Nepal.[7][8][9] Prior censuses placed the population of tigers in Bhutan at around 65-75 individuals, however, the latest census estimated that 103 wild Bengal tigers are living in the country.

      <p>Narcolepsy is a chronic neurological disorder involving the loss of the brain's ability to regulate sleep-wake cycles.[1] Symptoms include excessive daytime sleepiness, comparable to how people who do not have narcolepsy feel after 24–48 hours of sleep deprivation,[2] as well as disturbed sleep which often is confused with insomnia. Another common symptom of narcolepsy is cataplexy, a sudden and transient episode of muscle weakness accompanied by full conscious awareness, typically (though not necessarily) triggered by emotions such as laughing, crying, terror, etc.[3] affecting roughly 70% of people who have narcolepsy.

      <p>Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), also known as body dysmorphia or dysmorphic syndrome, but originally termed dysmorphophobia, is a mental disorder characterized by an obsessive preoccupation that some aspect of one's own appearance is severely flawed and warrants exceptional measures to hide or fix it.[1] In BDD's delusional variant, the flaw is imagined.[2] If the flaw is actual, its importance is severely exaggerated.[2] Either way, one's thoughts about it are pervasive and intrusive, occupying up to several hours a day. The DSM-5 categorizes BDD in the obsessive–compulsive spectrum, and distinguishes it from anorexia nervosa.

      <h3>Whiskers</h3>
      <p>Whiskers loves to cuddle</p>
      <img src="http://www.pets4homes.co.uk/images/classifieds/2013/06/09/327751/large/silver-spotted-british-short-hair-whiskers-kitten-51c47e9062609.JPG">
      <p>Cuddle parties are described by organizers as "workshop/social-events" that give adults an opportunity to "give and receive welcomed affectionate touch in a no-expectation, friendly setting, according to your needs, desires, interests, and boundaries." Cuddle parties are described as nonsexual events and commonly kissing is not allowed.[2]
        A cuddle party is a group experience, while the one-on-one analog is a cuddlebuddy relationship. However, "cuddle-buddies" are almost always ongoing relationships after being formed from prior relationships (friendship, etc.) Whereas in formal cuddle parties usually each person only has prior bonds with part of the total membership and the membership relationships are often not ongoing (e.g. same group may never meet again or only a few times).
        They may be referred to as a "puppy pile party" or "Contact Comfort Gathering".
